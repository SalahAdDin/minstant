### *Created by: [SalahAdDin](https://github.com/SalahAdDin/)*

This is the final project for the [Web Application Development with JavaScript and MongoDB](https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-application-development) available
on Coursera.

### _Requierements_

- [x] **Task 1: Improve the look and feel**

    Adapt the templates and helper functions so that the messaging window displays usersâ€™ avatars next to their messages. Feel free to add other enhancements!

- [x] **Task 2: Implement data writing security**

    Remove the insecure package from the application and implement a Meteor method to allow the insertion of chat items in the Chats collection. Test that you cannot insert items directly any more.

- [x] **Task 3: Implement data reading security**

    Remove the autopublish package from the application and implement publish and subscribe for Chats. Users should only be able to retrieve chats that have their user id in either the user1Id field or the user2Id field. Test by logging in as different users and checking what you can see

> ### Challenge: Implement emoticons.
> Can you implement emoticon functionality which allows the user to insert graphical emoticons into their message? Emoticons are small icons such as smiley faces which are typical of this kind of application.
